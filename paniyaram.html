    <h1>Kuzhi Paniyaram</h1>
    <p>Paniyaram, also known as Kuzhi Paniyaram or Gunta Ponganalu, are savory, spiced, crisp, and soft dumplings made from leftover idli batter. They are easy to make and can be made gluten-free by skipping asafoetida in the recipe.</p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Batter Consistency:
        Ensure that the batter is well-fermented. Fermentation imparts a tangy flavor and lightness to the paniyaram.
        The batter should be thick but pourable. Adjust the consistency by adding water if needed.</p>
        <p>lavorful Additions:
            Customize your paniyaram by adding ingredients like finely chopped onions, green chilies, grated ginger, curry leaves, and coriander leaves.
            Optionally, temper the batter with mustard seeds, cumin, hing (asafoetida), and grated coconut for authentic South Indian flavors.</p>
