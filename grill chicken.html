    <h1>Grill Chicken</h1>
    <p> Grilled Chicken Recipes- A nicely done piece of steaming hot grilled chicken with its tantalizing aroma and mouth-watering flavour is really hard to resist.</p>
    <img src="grill.jpg" >
    <h1 style="co">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 cup orange juice (or juice from 4 navel oranges)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried fennel</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>½ onion (sliced)</li>
        <li>¼ cup Nama Shoyu soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves (chopped)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h1><strong>Instructions</strong></h1>
    <ol><li>Pound the Chicken
        Place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon freezer bag and pound to an even ½-inch thickness. This both tenderizes the meat and ensures even cooking. Left in their natural shape, the thin side of the fillet dries out while the thicker side finishes cooking. If you don’t have a meat mallet, a rolling pin or a saucepan will both work well.</li>
        <li>Make the Marinade
            Lemon is a key ingredient in this marinade, but I only use the zest. Contrary to conventional wisdom, acidic ingredients (such as vinegar or lemon juice) do not tenderize lean boneless chicken breasts. Just the opposite: they “cook” the exterior of the meat and give it a leathery texture. The zest gives the chicken ample lemon flavor without affecting the chicken’s succulent texture.</li>

            <li>Marinate
                Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl protects against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Grill
                    When you’re ready to eat, preheat your grill to high heat and oil the grates (clean, oiled grates will give you the best grill marks). Be sure your grill is very hot before cooking the chicken; you want nice grill marks and char in the short amount of time it takes to cook these. When pounded thin, chicken breasts only need 2 to 3 minutes per side…no more! If you try to flip the chicken and it feels stuck, try giving it 30 seconds. It’ll release naturally when it’s ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Make sure the chicken is completely cooled before freezing it.</p>
    <p>Keep the chicken pieces whole (no slicing before freezing).</p>
    <p>To avoid multiple pieces stuck together (which extends defrosting time), wrap each piece individually in plastic wrap and then place them all in a ziploc bag. This also allows you to defrost one piece at a time if you’d like.
