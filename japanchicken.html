    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul><li>350 grams chicken thigh fillets (cut into large bite-size pieces)</li>
        <li>20 grams corn flour (cornstarch)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for deep frying)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mirin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger (including juice)</li>
        <li>Cabbage or shredded lettuce (for serving)</li>
        <li>Parsley sprigs (for garnish)</li></ul>
        <h1><strong>Instructions</strong></h1>
        <ol><li>Cut the fillets into large bite size pieces – about 5cm x 4cm / 2″ x 1½”.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken pieces and the Marinade ingredients in a ziplock bag, and massage well to coat every piece of meat with the marinade.</li>
            <li>Marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pat-dry the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken pieces with corn flour/cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Deep-fry the chicken pieces at 160°C/320°F.</li>
            <li>Rest the fried chicken for 3-4 minutes, then deep-fry at 190-200°C/374-392°F.</li></ol>
            <h1>Tips</h1>
            <p>Cook the chicken pieces by deep frying them at a lower temperature (about 160-165°C/320-329°F). The objective of this step is to cook the chicken to just before fully cooked without browning the surface too much.</p>
            <p>Rest for 3-4 minutes during which the residual heat cooks the chicken through.</p>
            <p>Deep fry the chicken pieces for the second time at about 190-200°C/374-392°F to make the outside of the chicken crunchy. This step is necessary because the first frying will make soggy fried chicken due to the lower temperature.</p>
